                However, by exploiting FPGA-specific optimizations, it is

    abstract = {Large-scale graph processing poses challenges due to its size
                and irregular memory access patterns, causing performance
                degradation in common architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs.
                Recent research includes accelerating graph processing using
                Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs can provide very
                efficient acceleration thanks to reconfigurable on-chip
                resources. Although limited, these resources offer a larger
                design space than CPUs and GPUs. We propose an approach in which
                data are preprocessed in small chunks with an optimized graph
                partitioning technique for execution on FPGA accelerators. The
                chunks, located on the host, are streamed directly into a
                customized memory layer implemented in the FPGA, which is tightly
                coupled with the processing elements responsible for the graph
                algorithm execution. This improves application memory access
                latency, which is crucial in large-sale graph computing
                performance. This work presents a hardware design that, combined
                with graph partitioning, enables us to achieve high-performance
                and potentially scalable handling of large graphs (i.e., graphs
                with millions of vertices and billions of edges in current
                scenarios) while using popular graph algorithms. The proposed
                framework accelerates performance 56 times compared with CPU
                (multicore with 16 logical cores in our reference experiments),
                2.5 times and 4 times faster compared to state-of-the-art FPGA
                and GPU solutions (FPGA has 15 compute units, and GPU reference
                has 128 streaming-multiprocessors in our experiments),
                respectively, when using the PageRank algorithm. For the
                Single-Source-Shortest-Past (SSSP) algorithm, we achieve speedups
                of up to 65x, 26x, and 18x compared to CPU, GPU, and FPGA works,
                respectively. Lastly, in the context of the Weakly Connected
                Component (WCC) algorithm, our framework achieves a speedup of up
                to 403 times compared to the CPU, 7.4x against the GPU, and it is
                faster than the FPGA alternatives up to 10.3x.},

abstract = {Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have made a significant impact on various domains. However, LLMs' efficiency suffers from both heavy computation and memory overheads. Compression techniques like sparsification and quantization are commonly used to mitigate the gap between LLM's computation/memory overheads and hardware capacity. However, existing GPU and transformer-based accelerators cannot efficiently process compressed LLMs, due to the following unresolved challenges: low computational efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads. This paper proposes FlightLLM, enabling efficient LLMs inference with a complete mapping flow on FPGAs. In FlightLLM, we highlight an innovative solution that the computation and memory overhead of LLMs can be solved by utilizing FPGA-specific resources (e.g., DSP48 and heterogeneous memory hierarchy). We propose a configurable sparse DSP chain to support different sparsity patterns with high computation efficiency. Second, we propose an always-on-chip decode scheme to boost memory bandwidth with mixed-precision support. Finally, to make FlightLLM available for real-world LLMs, we propose a length adaptive compilation method to reduce the compilation overhead. Implemented on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, FlightLLM achieves 6.0\texttimes{} higher energy efficiency and 1.8\texttimes{} better cost efficiency against commercial GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100S) on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2-7B) using vLLM and SmoothQuant under the batch size of one. FlightLLM beats NVIDIA A100 GPU with 1.2\texttimes{} higher throughput using the latest Versal VHK158 FPGA.},

abstract = {In recent years, the adoption of FPGAs in datacenters has increased, with a growing number of users choosing High-Level Synthesis (HLS) as their preferred programming method. While HLS simplifies FPGA programming, one notable challenge arises when scaling up designs for modern datacenter FPGAs that comprise multiple dies. The extra delays introduced due to die crossings and routing congestion can significantly degrade the frequency of large designs on these FPGA boards. Due to the gap between HLS design and physical design, it is challenging for HLS programmers to analyze and identify the root causes, and fix their HLS design to achieve better timing closure. Recent efforts have aimed to address these issues by employing coarse-grained floorplanning and pipelining strategies on task-parallel HLS designs where multiple tasks run concurrently and communicate through FIFO stream channels. However, many applications are not streaming friendly and many existing accelerator designs heavily rely on buffer channel based communication between tasks.In this work, we take a step further to support a task-parallel programming model where tasks can communicate via both FIFO stream channels and buffer channels. To achieve this goal, we design and implement the PASTA framework, which takes a large task-parallel HLS design as input and automatically generates a high-frequency FPGA accelerator via HLS and physical design co-optimization. Our framework introduces a latency-insensitive buffer channel design, which supports memory partitioning and ping-pong buffering while remaining compatible with vendor HLS tools. On the frontend, we provide an easy-to-use programming model for utilizing the proposed buffer channel; while on the backend, we implement efficient placement and pipelining strategies for the proposed buffer channel. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we test it on four widely used Rodinia HLS benchmarks and two real-world accelerator designs and show an average frequency improvement of 25\%, with peak improvements of up to 89\% on AMD/Xilinx Alveo U280 boards compared to Vitis HLS baselines.},

abstract = {FPGA has been an emerging computing infrastructure in datacenters benefiting from features of fine-grained parallelism, energy efficiency, and reconfigurability. Meanwhile, graph processing has attracted tremendous interest in data analytics, and its performance is in increasing demand with the rapid growth of data. Many works have been proposed to tackle the challenges of designing efficient FPGA-based accelerators for graph processing. However, the largely overlooked programmability still requires hardware design expertise and sizable development efforts from developers.In order to close the gap, we propose ThunderGP, an open-source HLS-based graph processing framework on FPGAs, with which developers could enjoy the performance of FPGA-accelerated graph processing by writing only a few high-level functions with no knowledge of the hardware. ThunderGP adopts the Gather-Apply-Scatter (GAS) model as the abstraction of various graph algorithms and realizes the model by a build-in highly-paralleled and memory-efficient accelerator template. With high-level functions as inputs, ThunderGP automatically explores the massive resources and memory bandwidth of multiple Super Logic Regions (SLRs) on FPGAs to generate accelerator and then deploys the accelerator and schedules tasks for the accelerator. We evaluate ThunderGP with seven common graph applications. The results show that accelerators on real hardware platforms deliver 2.9 times speedup over the state-of-the-art approach, running at 250MHz and achieving throughput up to 6,400 MTEPS (Million Traversed Edges Per Second). We also conduct a case study with ThunderGP, which delivers up to 419 times speedup over the CPU-based design and requires significantly reduced development efforts.

abstract = {FPGAs require a much longer compilation cycle than conventional computing platforms like CPUs. In this paper, we shorten the overall compilation time by co-optimizing the HLS compilation (C-to-RTL) and the back-end physical implementation (RTL-to-bitstream). We propose a split compilation approach based on the pipelining flexibility at the HLS level, which allows us to partition designs for parallel placement and routing then stitch the separate partitions together. We outline a number of technical challenges and address them by breaking the conventional boundaries between different stages of the traditional FPGA tool flow and reorganizing them to achieve a fast end-to-end compilation. Our research produces RapidStream, a parallelized and physical-integrated compilation framework that takes in an HLS dataflow program in C/C++ and generates a fully placed and routed implementation. When tested on the Xilinx U250 FPGA with a set of realistic HLS designs, RapidStream achieves a 5-7X reduction in compile time and up to 1.3X increase in frequency when compared to a commercial-off-the-shelf toolchain. In addition, we provide preliminary results using a customized open-source router to reduce the compile time up to an order of magnitude in the cases with lower performance requirements.

    abstract = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely employed for image recognition because it can achieve high accuracy by emulating behavior of optic nerves in living creatures. Recently, rapid growth of modern applications based on deep learning algorithms has further improved research and implementations. Especially, various accelerators for deep CNN have been proposed based on FPGA platform because it has advantages of high performance, reconfigurability, and fast development round, etc. Although current FPGA accelerators have demonstrated better performance over generic processors, the accelerator design space has not been well exploited. One critical problem is that the computation throughput may not well match the memory bandwidth provided an FPGA platform. Consequently, existing approaches cannot achieve best performance due to under-utilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. At the same time, the increasing complexity and scalability of deep learning applications aggravate this problem. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an analytical design scheme using the roofline model. For any solution of a CNN design, we quantitatively analyze its computing throughput and required memory bandwidth using various optimization techniques, such as loop tiling and transformation. Then, with the help of rooine model, we can identify the solution with best performance and lowest FPGA resource requirement. As a case study, we implement a CNN accelerator on a VC707 FPGA board and compare it to previous approaches. Our implementation achieves a peak performance of 61.62 GFLOPS under 100MHz working frequency, which outperform previous approaches significantly.},
